Hey Everyone, its Lo!

        I am super excited about embarking on my new journey here at Kenzie! 
        As a first time software engineering student, I must say that it is only week two and I feel as if Ive been a tech for quite a while.
        The instrucstors encourage us as students to take our time and move at our pace, a lot of information has to be taken in but it is important to understand too.
